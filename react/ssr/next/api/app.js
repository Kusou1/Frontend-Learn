      "<p>Time for a new episode of Marvel Presents: The World's Greatest Book Club with Paul Scheer -- and this one, Marvelites, is super-sized! Why? Because there's a new Marvel comic event in our midst, and EMPYRE deserves no less than a big celebration with hosts Paul Scheer and Steve Wacker! Paul and Steve are joined by guest Anthony Carboni (The Star Wars Show) for a calamitous conversation about other notable Marvel events.</p><video controls src='"+url+"/api/videos/1.mp4'></video><p>But first -- EMPYRE! Steve provided an inside look at the creation of the intergalactic conflict and what Marvel fans can expect:</p><p>‚ÄúWhat [writers Al Ewing and Dan Slott] definitely wanted to get away from was making it a [Fantastic Four] versus the Avengers, yet another story where friends fight each other and try to kill each other. Much like this show.‚Äù</p><p>He went on to predict the lasting effects of EMPYRE on the Marvel Universe:</p><p>‚ÄúThere are some big changes coming, and I think when we‚Äôre in our sweet spot is when we at Marvel are a little nervous about how the fans are going to react. It‚Äôs our job to put them through the ringer, to put them through hell. I think EMPYRE is not the story at the beginning that you think it is.‚Äù</p>"
